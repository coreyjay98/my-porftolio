# **Corey's Portfolio**

## Description
This project serves as a basic showcase of the current HTML and CSS skills that I have developed over the time in my course so far. I have created a basic portfolio website that includes features such as: 
*An Image of myself

*Short description of my skills and background information

*Images showcasing my portfolio of work so far

*A contact page that allows visitors to the site to leave me an email easily

*A responsive and well built website that can be easily viewed on multiple devices

A key factor to the creation of this website was the framework Bootstrap 4, I utilized the grid feature and also the pre made components such as nav bars and form pages to get a professional look for my project. I also used Google Fonts to pick out a sleek and suitable font to match the page. I did not have any images to add to my portfolio page so I decided to add placeholder images to give an example of the responsiveness of the portfolio page.

This project was a learning curve for me as I had to work out the inner intricacies of Bootstrap and so I put a lot of time into researching and figuring out how to use Bootstrap for the best possible outcomes. This meant that even for basic tasks like changing the colour of the navbar I would have to scour the Bootstrap website and Google to determine how to use the css in tandem with the Bootstrap CSS. This was slightly confusing for me as I had no opportunity to look into the Bootstrap CSS and so I felt as if I was guessing what I needed to change at some points, although this trial and error method allowed me to learn a lot more about how Bootstrap works and the CSS behind it.
